/**
 * @module Middlewares
 * @description This module comprises various middleware functions designed to enhance and manage the HTTP request-response lifecycle within the Express application. Middleware functions are integral to handling common tasks such as request logging, authentication, validation, and error handling. Currently, this module primarily focuses on error handling.
 * 
 * As the application evolves, additional middlewares may be added to address new requirements or improve existing functionality.
 * 
 * @see {@link module:Middlewares.errorHandler} to see how we are handling errors in our application.
 * 
 * @see {@link https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html} for more details on middleware in Express.
 * 
 * @example
 * // Using errorHandler middleware in an Express application
 * const express = require('express');
 * const { errorHandler } = require('./middlewares');
 * 
 * const app = express();
 * 
 * // Other middleware and routes go here
 * 
 * // Error handling middleware should be the last piece of middleware added to the app
 * app.use(errorHandler);
